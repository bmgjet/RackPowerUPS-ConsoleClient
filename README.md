## üìä Features

* Poll UPS status every second
* Display UPS information including:

  * Battery voltage, current, capacity, temperature, remaining time
  * Load, watts, VA
  * Charger current, inverter voltage, IGBT temps
  * Total energy usage and cost

## üìä SQLite

* Adding [sqlite3.dll](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmgjet/RackPowerUPS-ConsoleClient/refs/heads/main/sqlite3.dll) to the same folder as RackPowerUPSConsole.exe will trigger the application to dump each sample from the UPS to ups_logs.db. This can be used to view graphs of data over time. It will consume about 600kb per hour.<br>
